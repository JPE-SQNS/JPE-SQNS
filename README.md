Hi everybody

My name is Jerome Peraldi and I'm working in Sequans Communications Company.
Sequans is new partner with OAI and we follow the different development related to eNB as we want to design a test platform for testing our 4G/5G devices.
Our test platform will be based on 3GPP 36523 and 38523 specifications (Protocol stack related tests)
